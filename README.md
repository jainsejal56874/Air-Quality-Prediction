# Air-Quality-Prediction

Context

Since industrialization, there has been an increasing concern about environmental pollution. As mentioned in the WHO report 7 million premature deaths annually linked to air pollution , air pollution is the world's largest single environmental risk. Moreover as reported in the NY Times article, India’s Air Pollution Rivals China’s as World’s Deadliest it has been found that India's air pollution is deadlier than even China's.

Using this dataset, one can explore India's air pollution levels at a more granular scale.
